<Project 1 - Interactive Fiction Game> FutureOrPast, 11 September 2021

Have you ever time traveled? Probably not. This simple interactive fiction game engine helps you taste a sip of your mental state when time traveling. A player may pick two options, either future or past, or sometimes more, to escape from the infinite time loop. This great escape can exist because of some unknown man who comes from the 5th-dimensional world. Please send some applause to him as well.
